"""#903 (patch 0021) -- a turn's GDN boundary must survive the prefill chunk seam.

A prefill forward tracks a GDN snapshot boundary only when ITS OWN chunk is at least
``CHUNK_SIZE + 1`` tokens (``attention/linear.py:_build_track_metadata``), and only the FINAL
chunk of a turn commits (``scheduler.py`` skips ``ChunkedReq``). Before patch 0021
``scheduler/prefill.py`` rebuilt each continuation ``Req`` WITHOUT ``mamba_last_track_seqlen``,
so an earlier chunk's boundary was discarded at the seam: a turn whose last chunk was short
donated no reusable resume point at all, and the next turn resumed from the last turn that did
(#899 -- 18/18 exact against three banked loads).

⛔ CPU only: no GPU, no engine, no kernels. The tests drive the real ``PrefillAdder`` chunking,
the real ``_build_track_metadata`` bookkeeping and the real ``CacheManager`` /
``HybridRadixCache`` commit, and stand in for the GDN kernel by writing a per-boundary MARKER
into the slot ``_build_track_metadata`` itself nominated (``track_dst``).

⭐ That marker is what makes this a correctness test and not a plumbing test: the tree's answer
for prefix ``[0, L)`` is checked by CONTENT, so a snapshot captured at one boundary and
committed against a different one fails loudly instead of passing quietly. ⛔ A snapshot
donated at ``L`` claims the GDN state at ``L`` is what a future request restores from -- get
that wrong and the row serves wrong continuations with no error and no crash.
